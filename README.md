# I wanted to learn JavaScript and Web development, and this is my first ever fullstack project using TypeScript(a subset of JavaScript, basically JS+).

I find "normal" beginner programming tutorials extremely boring, and by this I mean the ones that explain simple concepts like comments, for loops, mathematical operations in
frustratingly high detail. I much prefer learning programming by following entire project tutorials, like this one, where I can learn the necessary information on the fly.
Even though I had nearly 0 experience in Web devving, JavaScript or TypeScript or practically anything related to the industry, I really feel like I have absorbed more
information in less than a week than in school, where I was first introduced to this about 3 years ago.

This entire project was a beginner tutorial into Web development using the MERN-stack (MongoDb, Express, React, NodeJS) by Florian Walther(Youtube channel: Coding in Flow, credits: https://youtu.be/FcxjCPeicvU).

I am still very much a beginner, but I fully intend to learn JS (and TS) along with React and other useful libraries through and through by 
following similar project tutorials on Youtube (I have already decided on a few, and I will have them on here shortly).
